### Description
The Simple Shell Program is a UNIX command interpreter that imitates the function of the simple shell (sh). It's written using C language only and its a milestone project for [Alx/Holberton School](https://www.alxafrica.com)

### Installation
Clone this repository into your working directory. For best results, files should be compiled with GCC and the following flags: -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89

### Use
After compilation of all C files, the resulting program can run stand-alone, either in interactive or non-interactive mode.

* Interactive Mode: In interactive mode, simply run the program and wait for the prompt to appear. From there, you can type commands freely, exiting with either the "exit" command or ctrl-D.
* In non-interactive mode, echo your desired command and pipe it into the program like this:

```sh
echo "ls" | ./shell
```
